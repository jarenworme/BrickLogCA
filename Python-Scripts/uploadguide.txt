(1) Download sets and themes folders from the site at https://rebrickable.com/downloads/

(2) Place the zipped downloaded folders in the Python-Scripts folder.

(3) Navigate to the folder in the terminal and activate the virtual environment:
	cd OneDrive\Desktop\legologv2\Python-Scripts
	virt\Scripts\activate.bat

(4) Run extractgz.py for themes, changing the file name in the python file if necessary for extracting sets.
(since for whatever reason you can open and extract the data from sets to get the csv)
	python extractgz.py

(5) Run parsethemes.py , legocsvtrimmer.py then csvtojson.py.
	python parsethemes.py
	python legocsvtrimmer.py
	python csvtojson.py

There may be some undefined char errors when running legocsvtrimmer.py so open the sets.csv file and delete anything that is missing
manually. There are a couple near the top, set 752437W-1 and the rest are in the set numbers that start with letters so delete all of
those directly. If there are more issues, uncomment the print line in the script so you can see where any remaining probem areas are.

(6) Copy paste the sets.json generated to the scripts folder in the repo.

(7) Open the firebase console and delete the global-sets collection. Then make a new one with the same name with one dummy doc.
This is to ensure the sets are not sudplicated as the given ids are random.

(8) Open a new terminal (?) and run the following:
	cd OneDrive\Desktop\legologv2\scripts
	node importdata.js

(9) Cleanup the folders by deleting the gz folders and csv files, and upload to GitHub if desired.

If you get the success print after a few minutes, check that the data is now in the global-sets collection and you are done!
